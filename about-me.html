  <h2>Jonathan Almeida</h2>
  <p>Hey everyone! My name is Jonathan, I'm 30 years old and I live in Santa Catarina - Brazil. I'm married and a father of a little princess.</p>
  <p>I'm studying now to become a developer, I am currently working for a hosting company (where the websites are hosted) how support, and this is an area that I really like to work in, but I need to search for new opportunities to my career and I choose this bachelor of applied to technology for it. I studied CSS and HTML in the past but there are a lot of things that I forgot, so will be a great opportunity to learn and improve these skills. </p>
  <p>I have been a member of the church for 17 years, my favorite quote is "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you"</p>
  <p>Good Luck guys</p>
